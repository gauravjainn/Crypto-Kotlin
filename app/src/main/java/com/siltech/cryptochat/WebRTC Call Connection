    -> User connect's to webSocket when the app starts with their UserId.

    -> For eg-> We have two user's User_A and User_B.

    -> Now User_A call's User_B.

    -> On call button from chat it redirect to Calling Screen (WebRtcCallActivity) and in calling screen it call Api GetPeer
    in which both Caller UserId and Receiver UserId passed and we get both user's socketId.

    -> And also establish the PeerConnection with the required stun/turn server URL's where you find in WebRtcCallActivity file createPeerConnection() function.

    /** we have socket Emit and Listener ->  "callUser" **/

    -> User_A call to User_B with required data like ConnId (SDP) , UserId, Socket Id, and other calling status and emit "call_user" socket.

    -> User_B get/listens the realTime data through socket which User_A sent and connects with required data and User_B also emit socket with required data
    like call status and all to User_A.

    -> And Call get connected.

    -> If User_A/User_B disconnects they emit the socket with required data of call status and call get's disconnected and stream's get removed at both sides.
